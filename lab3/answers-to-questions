2.1(a) State space is the all possible (x, y) coordinates and heading the robot in the grid spacei. The cardinality of the state space is 12|L||W| = 432 for the case where L = W = 6.

2.1(b) Actions include {stay still} + {forwards, backwards} x {rotate clockwise, rotate counterclockwise}. Some actions are not available in some states. For instance, in the middle states, the action stay still + rotate clockwise and stay still + rotate counterclockwise are not available.

2.1(c) function implemented in transition_prob()
