2.1(a) State space consists of all possible (x, y, heading) configurations of the robot in the grid space. The cardinality of the state space is 12|L||W| = 432 for the case where L = W = 6.

2.1(b) Actions include {stay still} + {forwards, backwards} x {rotate clockwise, rotate counterclockwise, no rotation}. Thus, the cardinality of the action space is 7.

2.1(c) function implemented in get_p() method in the Environment class in file env.py.

2.1(d) function implemented in get_next_state() method in the Environment class in file env.py.
